## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project I've refreshed my memory of clamp function, which allows us to set a font-size that shrinks and grows along with the site's width. Thanks to this I didn't have to use media queries in this project at all and still achieve a proper card and text responsiveness.

[Check out clamp!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp)

### Continued development

In case of further development I still need to work on my mobile-first workflow, as I often tend to jump straight to coding the desktop view.
